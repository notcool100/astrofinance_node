# Administration Module Staff Management Fix

## Problem Description
The Administration module's "Staff" link was redirecting users to the login page instead of taking them to a proper staff management interface where admins could create and manage staff members.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Navigation Configuration Issue**: The navigation item for "Staff" was pointing to `/staff` instead of `/admin/staff`
2. **Missing Route Protection**: Admin staff pages weren't properly protected with `adminOnly` authentication
3. **Incomplete Page Structure**: Some admin staff management pages were missing (edit, reset password)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Navigation Configuration
- **File**: `be/src/scripts/update-staff-navigation.ts`
- **Action**: Created and executed a script to update the navigation database
- **Change**: Updated staff navigation item URL from `/staff` to `/admin/staff`
- **Result**: Staff link now correctly points to admin staff management

### 2. Added Route Protection
- **Files Modified**:
  - `fe/src/pages/admin/staff/index.tsx`
  - `fe/src/pages/admin/staff/create.tsx`
  - `fe/src/pages/admin/staff/[id].tsx`
  - `fe/src/pages/admin/staff/[id]/edit.tsx`
  - `fe/src/pages/admin/staff/[id]/reset-password.tsx`

- **Action**: Added `ProtectedRoute` component with `adminOnly` prop to all admin staff pages
- **Result**: Only authenticated admin users can access staff management pages

### 3. Created Missing Admin Staff Pages
- **New Files Created**:
  - `fe/src/pages/admin/staff/[id]/edit.tsx` - Edit staff member details
  - `fe/src/pages/admin/staff/[id]/reset-password.tsx` - Reset staff password

- **Features**:
  - Edit staff member information with form validation
  - Reset staff passwords with confirmation
  - Proper error handling and success messages
  - Admin-only access protection

### 5. Reset Password (`/admin/staff/[id]/reset-password`)

- Success/error message handling

## Database Changes
- Updated `navigation_items` table to change staff URL from `/staff` to `/admin/staff`
- No schema changes required - existing staff management tables were already in place

## Backend API Endpoints
All necessary backend endpoints already existed:
- `GET /admin/staff` - Get all staff members
- `GET /admin/staff/:id` - Get staff by ID
- `POST /admin/staff` - Create new staff member
- `PUT /admin/staff/:id` - Update staff member
- `POST /admin/staff/:id/reset-password` - Reset staff password
- `DELETE /admin/staff/:id` - Delete staff member

## Security Features
- **Authentication**: All admin staff routes require admin authentication
- **Authorization**: Only Super Admin role can access staff management
- **Input Validation**: Form validation on both frontend and backend
- **Password Security**: Secure password reset functionality

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the backend server: `cd be && npm run dev`
2. Start the frontend server: `cd fe && npm run dev`
3. Login as an admin user
4. Navigate to Administration â†’ Staff
5. Test the following features:
   - View staff list
   - Create new staff member
   - View staff details
   - Edit staff information
   - Reset staff password
