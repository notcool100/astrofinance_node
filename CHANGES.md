# AstroFinance System Redesign

## Unified Role-Based Authentication System

### Backend Changes

1. Created a new `office` module that handles authentication for both admin and staff users
   - Created `office/controllers/auth.controller.ts` with unified login, logout, profile, and password change functions
   - Created `office/routes.ts` to expose the new unified API endpoints

2. Updated the authentication middleware to support role-based access control
   - Added a unified `authenticate` middleware that works with all user types
   - Enhanced the `hasPermission` middleware to check permissions based on user roles
   - Added support for a unified `user` object on the request

3. Updated the main application to include the new office routes
   - Added the new office routes to the Express application

### Frontend Changes

1. Updated the authentication service
   - Replaced separate admin and staff authentication functions with unified office functions
   - Added permission checking and navigation retrieval functions

2. Updated the authentication context
   - Modified the login function to use the unified office authentication
   - Added permission checking and navigation retrieval functions
   - Added an `isOfficeUser` flag to easily identify office users

3. Created a dynamic navigation component
   - Implemented `DynamicNavigation.tsx` that displays menu items based on user permissions
   - Replaced the separate admin and staff navigation components

4. Updated the main layout
   - Modified `MainLayout.tsx` to use the dynamic navigation component
   - Updated URL paths to use the new `/office/` prefix for all office users

5. Created unified office pages
   - Implemented `office/dashboard.tsx` with permission-based content display
   - Implemented `office/profile.tsx` for user profile management

## Benefits of the New Design

1. **Simplified Authentication**: One authentication system for all office users (admin and staff)
2. **Dynamic Navigation**: Menu items are displayed based on user permissions
3. **Consistent URL Structure**: All office-related pages use the `/office/` prefix
4. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated duplicate code for admin and staff functionality
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to authentication or navigation only need to be made in one place
6. **Better Security**: Permissions are checked consistently throughout the application

## Next Steps

1. Migrate existing admin and staff pages to the new office structure
2. Update all API calls to use the new unified endpoints
3. Implement additional permission checks in the frontend components
4. Create comprehensive documentation for the new role-based system
