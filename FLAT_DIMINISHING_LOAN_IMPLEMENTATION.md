# Flat vs Diminishing Loan Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of both Flat and Diminishing (Reducing Balance) loan types in the AstroFinance system. The system now supports both interest calculation methods, allowing users to choose the most suitable option for their needs.

## üìä Loan Type Comparison

| Point | Flat Loan | Diminishing (Reducing Balance) Loan |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| Interest calculation | Charged on the entire original principal for the whole tenure | Charged only on the outstanding balance (reduces every installment) |
| Monthly Installment (EMI) | Same split of principal + fixed interest | EMI usually fixed, but interest portion decreases and principal portion increases |
| Total Interest Cost | Higher (because interest does not reduce even after paying principal) | Lower (because interest reduces as balance reduces) |

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The database already had support for both loan types through the `InterestType` enum:

```prisma
enum InterestType {
  FLAT
  DIMINISHING
}

model LoanType {
  id                   String                  @id @default(uuid())
  name                 String
  code                 String                  @unique
  interestType         InterestType
  minAmount            Decimal                 @db.Decimal(15, 2)
  maxAmount            Decimal                 @db.Decimal(15, 2)
  minTenure            Int
  maxTenure            Int
  interestRate         Decimal                 @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  processingFeePercent Decimal                 @default(0) @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  lateFeeAmount        Decimal                 @default(0) @db.Decimal(10, 2)
  isActive             Boolean                 @default(true)
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Backend Implementation

#### Loan Calculation Utilities (`be/src/modules/loan/utils/loan.utils.ts`)

The system includes comprehensive calculation functions:

1. **`calculateEMI()`** - Calculates EMI for both loan types
2. **`generateRepaymentSchedule()`** - Generates detailed repayment schedules
3. **`compareInterestMethods()`** - Compares both methods side by side

#### Key Features:

- **Flat Interest Calculation**: Fixed monthly interest on original principal
- **Diminishing Interest Calculation**: Interest calculated on reducing balance
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Proper validation for both loan types
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged for compliance

### Frontend Implementation

#### Loan Calculator (`fe/src/components/calculators/LoanCalculator.tsx`)

The calculator supports:
- Real-time EMI calculation for both loan types
- Side-by-side comparison of both methods
- Interactive charts showing payment breakdown
- Amortization schedule generation
- Preset saving and history tracking

#### Loan Application Form (`fe/src/components/forms/LoanApplicationForm.tsx`)

The application form includes:
- Loan type selection with interest type display
- Automatic EMI calculation based on selected loan type
- Validation based on loan type constraints
- Real-time form updates
