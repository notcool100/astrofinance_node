# Unified Role-Based Authentication System Implementation

## Overview

We've redesigned the authentication system to use a unified role-based approach for office users (both admin and staff). This eliminates the need for separate admin and staff authentication flows and creates a more maintainable and scalable system.

## Backend Changes

1. **Updated Office Auth Controller**
   - Modified `auth.controller.ts` to handle both admin and staff authentication
   - Implemented unified login, logout, profile, and password change functions
   - Added permission and navigation extraction for both user types

2. **Updated Office Routes**
   - Added validation middleware to the routes
   - Created validation schemas for login and password change

3. **Created Validators**
   - Implemented `auth.validator.ts` with schemas for login and password change

4. **Authentication Middleware**
   - The existing unified `authenticate` middleware already supported our approach
   - The `hasPermission` middleware checks permissions based on user roles

## Frontend Changes

1. **Updated Login Page**
   - Created a new login page that works with both admin and staff users
   - Added the ability to switch between admin and staff login

2. **Created Dynamic Navigation**
   - Implemented `DynamicNavigation.tsx` that displays menu items based on user permissions
   - Replaced separate admin and staff navigation components

3. **Updated Main Layout**
   - Modified `MainLayout.tsx` to use the dynamic navigation component
   - Updated URL paths to use the new `/office/` prefix for all office users

4. **Updated Auth Context**
   - Modified the login function to redirect to the unified office dashboard
   - Added support for permission checking

5. **Updated Auth Service**
   - Simplified the auth service to use the unified office endpoints
   - Added permission checking functions

6. **Created Office Dashboard**
   - Implemented a unified dashboard that displays content based on user permissions

7. **Created Office Profile Page**
   - Implemented a unified profile page for both admin and staff users

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Code**: Eliminated duplicate code for admin and staff functionality
2. **Consistent Authorization**: Permissions are checked in a consistent way throughout the application
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to authentication or navigation only need to be made in one place
4. **Better User Experience**: Users have a consistent interface regardless of their role
5. **Scalable Permission System**: Easy to add new permissions and roles without changing the core authentication logic

## Next Steps

1. **Migrate Existing Pages**: Convert remaining admin and staff pages to use the unified office approach
2. **Update API Calls**: Ensure all frontend API calls use the new unified endpoints
3. **Add More Permission Checks**: Implement permission checks in all components that need them
4. **Create Documentation**: Document the new role-based system for developers
