# AstroFinance Database Strategy

This document outlines the database backup, migration, and maintenance strategies for the AstroFinance system.

## Backup Strategy

### Daily Backups

- **Full Database Backup**: Automated daily full database backup at 2:00 AM
- **Retention Period**: 7 days for daily backups
- **Storage**: Primary backups stored on a separate backup server, with cloud replication

### Weekly Backups

- **Full Database Backup**: Every Sunday at 3:00 AM
- **Retention Period**: 4 weeks for weekly backups
- **Storage**: Primary storage plus offsite cloud storage

### Monthly Backups

- **Full Database Backup**: First day of each month at 4:00 AM
- **Retention Period**: 12 months for monthly backups
- **Storage**: Primary storage plus offsite cloud storage with encryption

### Backup Verification

- Automated restoration testing of backups to a test environment weekly
- Integrity checks on all backups
- Backup success/failure notifications to the database administrator

### Implementation

```bash
# Example PostgreSQL backup script (to be scheduled via cron)
pg_dump -U postgres -d fms_db -F c -f /backup/fms_db_$(date +%Y%m%d).dump

# Example restoration test
pg_restore -U postgres -d fms_db_test -c /backup/fms_db_latest.dump
```

## Migration Strategy

### Development Environment

1. Create migrations using Prisma Migrate:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_name
   ```

2. Test migrations in the development environment
3. Document changes and potential impacts

### Staging Environment

1. Apply migrations to staging:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

2. Perform thorough testing of all affected functionality
3. Verify data integrity
4. Measure performance impact

### Production Environment

1. Schedule migration during low-traffic periods
2. Create a pre-migration backup
3. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```
4. Verify application functionality
5. Monitor system performance

### Rollback Plan

1. Restore from pre-migration backup if issues occur
2. Have specific rollback migrations prepared for critical changes
3. Test rollback procedures in staging before production deployment

## Database Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

- **Vacuum and Analyze**: Weekly VACUUM ANALYZE to reclaim space and update statistics
- **Index Maintenance**: Monthly index rebuilding for fragmented indexes
- **Statistics Update**: Weekly update of database statistics

### Performance Monitoring

- Query performance monitoring with pg_stat_statements
- Regular review of slow queries (>500ms)
- Index usage analysis

### Implementation

```sql
-- Example maintenance queries
VACUUM ANALYZE;
REINDEX DATABASE fms_db;
ANALYZE;

-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Security Measures

### Access Control

- Database users with least privilege principles
- Role-based access control
- Regular permission audits

### Data Protection

- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- TDE (Transparent Data Encryption) for production
- Data masking for non-production environments

### Audit Logging

- Database-level audit logging for sensitive operations
- Retention of audit logs for 12 months
- Regular review of audit logs

## Scaling Strategy

### Vertical Scaling

- Monitor resource usage and increase server resources as needed
- Optimize for PostgreSQL performance (shared_buffers, work_mem, etc.)

### Horizontal Scaling

- Implement read replicas for reporting and analytics queries
- Consider sharding for very large datasets (if needed in the future)

### Connection Pooling

- Implement PgBouncer for connection pooling
- Configure appropriate pool sizes based on application needs

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

- Target: 4 hours for full system restoration

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

- Target: Maximum data loss of 15 minutes

### Disaster Recovery Testing

- Quarterly DR drills
- Documentation of recovery procedures
- Training for database administrators

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Set up monitoring for:
  - Database availability
  - Connection count
  - Query performance
  - Disk space
  - Replication lag
  - Backup success/failure

- Configure alerts for:
  - Database downtime
  - High CPU/memory usage
  - Slow queries
  - Failed backups
  - Replication issues
  - Security events
