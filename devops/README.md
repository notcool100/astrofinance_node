## CI/CD Pipelines

The project uses the following CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Frontend Pipeline**
   - Builds and deploys the Next.js frontend application
   - Includes linting, testing, and building steps
   - Deploys to Azure Web App

2. **Backend Pipeline**
   - Builds and deploys the Node.js backend application
   - Includes linting, testing, and building steps
   - Deploys to Azure Web App for Linux

3. **Database Pipeline**
   - Validates and applies database migrations
   - Includes validation and deployment steps
   - Executes migrations against the PostgreSQL database

## Environment Configuration

The project uses the following environments:

1. **Development**
   - For ongoing development work
   - Automatic deployments from the develop branch
   - Minimal approval requirements

2. **Testing**
   - For QA and testing
   - Deployments triggered manually or by PR completion
   - Basic approval requirements

3. **Staging**
   - Pre-production environment
   - Mirrors production configuration
   - Requires approvals for deployments

4. **Production**
   - Live environment
   - Strict approval requirements
   - Blue-green deployment strategy

## Infrastructure as Code

The infrastructure is defined using ARM templates or Terraform and includes:

1. **App Service Plans**
   - For hosting frontend and backend applications

2. **Web Apps**
   - For frontend and backend services
   - With deployment slots for blue-green deployments

3. **PostgreSQL Database**
   - Managed PostgreSQL service
   - With geo-redundant backups

4. **Storage Accounts**
   - For storing files, backups, and other assets

5. **Application Insights**
   - For monitoring and logging

6. **Key Vault**
   - For secure storage of secrets and credentials

## Monitoring and Alerting

The project uses the following monitoring tools:

1. **Application Insights**
   - For application performance monitoring
   - For exception tracking
   - For user behavior analytics

2. **Log Analytics**
   - For centralized logging
   - For log querying and analysis
   - For custom dashboards

3. **Azure Monitor**
   - For resource metrics
   - For health checks
   - For automated alerts

## Deployment Strategies

The project uses the following deployment strategies:

1. **Development**: Direct deployment
2. **Testing**: Deployment with basic validation
3. **Staging**: Blue-green deployment with smoke tests
4. **Production**: Blue-green deployment with full testing

## Security Considerations

The DevOps setup includes the following security measures:

1. **Secret Management**
   - All secrets stored in Azure Key Vault
   - No secrets in source code or pipeline variables

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access control for all resources
   - Minimal necessary permissions

3. **Security Scanning**
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Static code analysis
   - Container scanning (if applicable)

## Disaster Recovery

The disaster recovery plan includes:

1. **Database Backups**
   - Automated daily backups
   - Point-in-time restore capability
   - Geo-redundant storage

2. **Application Recovery**
   - Infrastructure as code for quick rebuilding
   - Documented recovery procedures
   - Regular recovery testing
