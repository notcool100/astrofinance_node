# AstroFinance Backup Scripts

This directory will contain scripts for backing up the AstroFinance application and database.

## Planned Scripts

The following scripts are planned for future implementation:

### 1. Database Backup (`backup-database.sh`)
- Automate PostgreSQL database backups
- Configure backup retention policies
- Implement geo-redundant storage

### 2. Application Backup (`backup-application.sh`)
- Back up application code and configuration
- Store backups in Azure Storage
- Implement versioning and retention policies

### 3. Scheduled Backups (`schedule-backups.sh`)
- Set up cron jobs for regular backups
- Configure backup windows
- Implement notification system for backup status

## Usage Guidelines

When implemented, these scripts should be:
- Run on a regular schedule
- Monitored for successful completion
- Tested regularly with restore procedures
- Integrated with Azure DevOps pipelines where appropriate
