# AstroFinance Frontend Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the frontend implementation for the AstroFinance project. The frontend is built using Next.js with TypeScript, following modern best practices for React development.

## Architecture

The frontend follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **Pages**: Next.js pages that define the routes and main views of the application
2. **Components**: Reusable UI components organized by functionality
3. **Services**: API service layer for communication with the backend
4. **Contexts**: React contexts for global state management
5. **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for shared logic
6. **Utilities**: Helper functions and utilities

## Key Features Implemented

### Authentication System

- JWT-based authentication
- User and admin login flows
- Registration for new users
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Role-based access control (admin vs regular users)

### UI Components

- Responsive layout with mobile support
- Dashboard for both users and admins
- Form components with validation
- Data tables with sorting and pagination
- Cards, buttons, and other reusable UI elements

### Loan Management

- Loan calculator with amortization schedule
- Loan application form
- Loan listing and details view
- Payment tracking

### Data Fetching

- React Query for server state management
- Axios for API communication
- Error handling and loading states

## Design Decisions

### State Management

- React Query for server state
- React Context for global UI state
- Local state for component-specific state

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Custom component classes for consistent UI
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Form Handling

- React Hook Form for form state management
- Yup for schema validation
- Consistent error handling and display

### Authentication

- JWT stored in localStorage
- Context-based auth state
- Protected routes with redirects
